<p>
I am a Ph.D. student and Project Assistant at the Visual Data Science Lab of the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria.
Before this, I finished my Computer Science BSc in 2019 and my Artificial Intelligence MSc in 2021 at Johannes Kepler University. In my Master's thesis, I delved deeper into Reinforcement Learning, focussing on Lifelong Reinforcement Learning in non-stationary environments.
</p>
<p>
Among others, the research topics I am interested in include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Explainable AI, and Dimensionality Reduction.
