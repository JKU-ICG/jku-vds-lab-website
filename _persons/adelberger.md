I'm a PhD student and university assistant in the Visual Data Science Lab of the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Linz, Austria.
My research focuses on interactive visualizations in the biomedical data visualization field. Together with my colleagues, I design and build data analysis tools to support domain experts.

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Medical Informatics at <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/">TU Wien</a> (Technical University of Vienna), Vienna, Austria.

I'm teaching the practical parts of the Visual Analytics, Information Visualization, Explainable AI, and Computer Graphics courses at the Johannes Kepler University.
