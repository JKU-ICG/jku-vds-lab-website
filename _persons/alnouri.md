<p>I am a project assistant in the Visual Data Science Lab at <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology Engineering with a specialization in AI, as well as a Master's degree in Big Data Systems. Throughout my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed as an AI engineer within various technology startups. My work in AI sparked a deep interest in XAI, which became the focus of both my undergraduate project and Master's thesis. 
</p>
<p>At the Visual Data Science Lab, my research revolve around the design and development of data analysis tools to support domain experts, with a specific emphasis on XAI. I am eager to pursue a PhD in this field, driven by my passion for telling stories with data and my understanding regarding the impact of enhancing the transparency and interpretability of AI systems.
