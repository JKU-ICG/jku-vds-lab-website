abstract: "A typical problem in Visual Analytics (VA) is that users are highly trained experts in their application domains, but have mostly no experience in using VA systems. Thus, users often have difficulties interpreting and working with visual representations. To overcome these problems, user assistance can be incorporated into VA systems to guide experts through the analysis while closing their knowledge gaps. Different types of user assistance can be applied to extend the power of VA, enhance the user’s experience, and broaden the audience for VA. Although different approaches to visualization onboarding and guidance in VA already exist, there is a lack of research on how to design and integrate them in effective and efficient ways. Therefore, we aim at putting together the pieces of the mosaic to form a coherent whole. Based on the Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics model, we contribute a conceptual model of user assistance for VA by integrating the process of visualization onboarding and guidance as the two main approaches in this direction. As a result, we clarify and discuss the commonalities and differences between visualization onboarding and guidance, and discuss how they benefit from the integration of knowledge extraction and exploration. Finally, we discuss our descriptive model by applying it to VA tools integrating visualization onboarding and guidance, and showing how they should be utilized in different phases of the analysis in order to be effective and accepted by the user.
