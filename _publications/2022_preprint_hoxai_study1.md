abstract: "Understanding the recommendation of an artificially intelligent (AI) assistant for decision-making is especially important
in high-risk tasks, such as deciding whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. To foster user understanding and appropriate trust in
such systems, we tested the effects of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods and an educational intervention on AI-assisted
decision-making behavior in a 2x2 between subjects online experiment with N = 410 participants. We developed a novel use case in which
users go on a virtual mushroom hunt and are tasked with picking only edible mushrooms but leaving poisonous ones. Additionally, users
were provided with an AI-based app that shows classification results of mushroom images. For the manipulation of explainability, one
subgroup additionally received attribution-based and example-based explanations of the AI's predictions, and for the educational
intervention one subgroup received additional information on how the AI worked. We found that the group with explanations outperformed
the group without explanations and showed more appropriate trust levels. Contrary to our expectation, we did not find effects for the
educational intervention, domain-specific knowledge, or AI knowledge on performance. We discuss practical implications and introduce the
mushroom-picking task as a promising use case for XAI research."
