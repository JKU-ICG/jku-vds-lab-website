abstract: "Presentation of multiple interactions is of vital importance in the new field of cytomics. Quantitative analysis of multi- and polychromatic stained cells in tissue will serve as a basis for medical diagnosis and prediction of disease in forthcoming years. A major problem asso- ciated with huge interdependent data sets is visualization. Therefore, alternative and easy-to-handle strategies for data visualization as well as data meta-evaluation (popula- tion analysis, cross-correlation, co-expression analysis) were developed."
