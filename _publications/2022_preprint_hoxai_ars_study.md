abstract: "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) enables an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to explain its decisions. This holds the promise of making AI more understandable to users, improving interaction, and establishing an adequate level of trust. We tested this assertion in the high-risk task of mushroom hunting, where users have to decide whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous with the aid of an AI-based app that suggests classifications based on mushroom images. In a between-subjects experiment N = 328 visitors of an Austrian media art exhibition played a mushroom hunting game on tablet computers while walking through a highly immersive artificial indoor forest. One group saw the AI's decisions only, while a second group additionally received attribution-based and example-based visual explanations of the AI's recommendation. The results show that participants with visual explanations outperformed participants without explanations in correct edibility assessments and pick-up decisions. This exhibition-based experiment thus replicated the decision-making results of a previous online study. However, unlike in the previous study, the visual explanations did not affect levels of trust or acceptance measures. In a direct comparison, we consequently discuss the findings in terms of generalizability. Besides the scientific contribution, we discuss the direct impact of conducting XAI experiments in highly immersive art- and game-based environments in exhibition contexts on visitors and local communities by triggering reflection and awareness for psychological issues of human-AI interaction."

# Acknowledgements

We thank Birke van Maartens for the artistic concept of the artificial forest and the
scenery design, Nives Meloni for coordinating the exhibition area, Leonie Haasler and
Gabriel Vitel for the construction of the artificial forest (stage building), Moritz Heckmann
for helping to implement the game, Kenji Tanaka for the sound design, and Stefan
Eibelwimmer for the graphic design of the tablet game and Christopher Lindinger who
helped in the conceptualization of the game. Additionally, we thank the Johannes Kepler
University press team and Roman Peherstorfer and his team for the video documentation
of the installation. Furthermore, we also thank all the student assistants and colleagues
from the Robopsychology Lab at Johannes Kepler University Linz who actively supported
the installation and data collection and who also spontaneously stepped in to help when
the number of visitors was high. Finally, we thank Dr. Otto Stoik and the members of the
Mycological Working Group (MYAG) at the Biology Center Linz, Austria, who supported
us in the development of items for the mushroom knowledge test and provided mushroom
images for this study. We also thank the members of the German Mycological Society
(DGfM) for providing additional images.
