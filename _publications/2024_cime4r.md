abstract: "Chemical reaction optimization (RO) is an iterative process that results in large, high-dimensional datasets. Current tools allow for only limited analysis and understanding of parameter spaces, making it hard for scientists to review or follow changes throughout the process. With the recent emergence of using artificial intelligence (AI) models to aid RO, another level of complexity has been added. Helping to assess the quality of a model’s prediction and understand its decision is critical to supporting human-AI collaboration and trust calibration. To address this, we propose CIME4R—an open-source interactive web application for analyzing RO data and AI predictions. CIME4R supports users in (i) comprehending a reaction parameter space, (ii) investigating how an RO process developed over iterations, (iii) identifying critical factors of a reaction, and (iv ) understanding model predictions. This facilitates making informed decisions during the RO process and helps users to review a completed RO process, especially in AI-guided RO. CIME4R aids decision-making through the interaction between humans and AI by combining the strengths of expert experience and high computational precision. We developed and tested CIME4R with domain experts and verified its usefulness in three case studies. Using CIME4R the experts were able to produce valuable insights from past RO campaigns and to make informed decisions on which experiments to perform next. We believe that CIME4R is the beginning of an open-source community project with the potential to improve the workflow of scientists working in the reaction optimization domain."
