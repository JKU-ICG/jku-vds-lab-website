abstract: "We aim at a visualization framework that empowers the user to reveal information that is not obvious just by look- ing at the graph. The keys to reach that goal are interactive graphs in combination with well established visualization methods. Techniques such as multiple views, linking & brushing, and focus + context are already implemented in the system. Furthermore the application is designed for fast and modular integration of alternative and/or new vi- sualization concepts."
